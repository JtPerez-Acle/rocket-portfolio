Project Overview: Data-Driven Web Application

Build a web application that dynamically presents data, allows users to interact with it, and performs data analysis based on user input or data changes.
Technologies

    Frontend: React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
    Backend: Rust with Rocket framework
    Database: PostgreSQL or SQLite 
    Data Analysis: Rust for backend processing of data

Proposed Features

    Dynamic Data Visualization: Display data in various formats (charts, graphs, tables).
    User Interaction: Allow users to filter, sort, and interact with the data.
    Data Analysis Module: Perform and display results of data analysis based on user input or automated processes.
    Responsive Design: Ensure the application is usable on both desktop and mobile devices.

Development Steps

    Setup and Configuration
        Create a new Rust project with Rocket.
        Set up a new React application.
        Configure Rust to serve the React build.
        Establish database connections.

    Backend Development
        Define the data models and database schema.
        Implement API endpoints in Rust for data retrieval, manipulation, and analysis.
        Ensure proper error handling and data validation.

    Frontend Development
        Develop UI components in React.
        Implement state management and API integration.
        Create dynamic and interactive data visualizations.
        Ensure responsiveness and accessibility.

    Data Analysis Integration
        Implement data processing and analysis algorithms in Rust.
        Expose data analysis functionality via API endpoints.
        Integrate analysis results into the frontend.

    Testing and Debugging
        Write unit and integration tests for both frontend and backend.
        Debug and refine based on test results.

    Deployment
        Prepare the application for production.
        Deploy to a suitable hosting platform.

Schema Example

    users table: Stores user information.
    data_records table: Stores the main data to be visualized and analyzed.
    analysis_results table: Stores results from data analysis operations.

Deliverables

    Rust project files (for Rocket and data analysis).
    React project files (including JS, HTML, CSS).
    Database schema files.
    Test cases and documentation.
